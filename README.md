# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing patient health data and building a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease. The objective is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and apply a classification algorithm to make accurate predictions. 

🎯 Objective:
Analyze heart disease data
Preprocess and encode features
Build a prediction model
Evaluate model performance

🛠️ Tools Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Workflow:
Data loading & inspection
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing & scaling
Train-test split
Logistic Regression model
Model evaluation

📊 Model:
Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

✅ Result:
The model predicts the presence of heart disease with reliable accuracy and serves as a strong baseline ML solution.
